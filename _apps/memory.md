desc: My version of famous game in which you find pairs of same cards. I wanted to practice graphics and logic, and also to have fun and exercize my memory :)

Game of Memory initially shows grid of cards upside down. Game is played by turning cards in pairs, and if they match, player gets a point. Goal is to find all the pairs with minimal time.

It'a an unfinished app - logic is working for various tile numbers, but it has only one type of card pictures: numbers. Graphics is also very raw. 

Plan is to have:
- at least 4-5 various picture collections - fruit, animals, flowers
- playing vs phone or another player, online or over wifi or bluetooth
- save best results and send them to google games
- show statistics
