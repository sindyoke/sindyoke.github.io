Hello and welcome to my homepage :)

What can you expect here in the future:
- Android [portfolio]({% link sindyoke-android-portfolio.md %}) - business, freelance apps and personal projects
- Android blog
  - my impressions of the conferences I visited
  - stuff I didn't find on one blogpost, but had to read _a lot_ to figure it out. I want to save you (and future me :) ) some time with that ;)
  - some projects I am working on, ideas, plans for the future
- Selfhelp posts, [conclusions]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-05-02-Scientific-proof-that-open-space-is-the-deep-work-enemy %}), writings, thinkings - I read a lot of books, blogposts and articles regarding selfhelp, but I wanna focus here on stuff that can help you business-wise: productivity, focus, [music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_cuXU7hlR8&list=PLkUyjutKXVvSOqhbNHqWkmGH_rYf-c4R_), [deep work](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted/dp/1455586692), [flow](https://www.amazon.com/Flow-Psychology-Experience-Perennial-Classics-ebook/dp/B000W94FE6/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=flow&qid=1556824681&s=books&sr=1-1)...
- Basic info [about me](https://about.me/sindyoke), so you can figure out what kind of person I am and whether you want to: contact me, hire me, befriend me

For now this is just a placeholder, I am focusing on my Android blog, reading Android books, finishing courses.
